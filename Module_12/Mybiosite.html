                                Paintball is one of my favorite hobbies, it's an extreme sport that releasees a lot of
                                stress for me. In a quick description Paintball is a competitive shooting sport where
                                players use air-powered guns to shoot small, round, paint-filled pellets at each other
                                to
                                eliminate opponents. There are two different styles that are played, Woodsball and
                                tournament style. I enjoy the tournament style more because of its quick up-close
                                fighting.
                                If you guys want to see what the difference are please check out these links!

                                Video games the gift that keeps on giving, I enjoy all kinds of games form multiplayer
                                first
                                person shooters to single player story games. I enjoy them all, I first got into video
                                games
                                when I was little when my dad gave me his first Super Nintendo from when he was a kid, I
                                was
                                hooked after playing Super Mario 3. I have been currently playing call of duty, Men of
                                war
                                assault squad 2, NCAA 14, and Kerbal Space Program. Kerbal Space Program is probably my
                                top
                                one right now because it deals with building rockets and flying to space, which I love
                                space.

                                Studying about space, is one of my top three favorite things to do when Iâ€™m not working
                                or
                                doing schoolwork. I enjoy learning about the great unknow above our heads and all the
                                things
                                we discover just in our local solar system. I hope to somehow work in the space field of
                                tech one day. I also plan on getting into astrophotography after I finish school, some
                                of
                                the pictures I see people take from their back yard are just jaw dropping. One of my
                                favorite planets that I love to learn about is Saturn, the rings, and beautiful colors
                                the
                                planet has too over are just mesmerizing. Not to mention the moons that it hosts, they
                                are
                                mini planets themselves, with one being a target for Nasa to search for life on.
